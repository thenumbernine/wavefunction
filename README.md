Hydrogen atom wavefunction visualizer

[Launch](https://thenumbernine.github.io/wavefunction/)

Built off a slice-based volume visualizer, which was built off a raytraced volumizer.

The current implementation is RGB baked from whatever float values you choose, out of the kindness of my heart.
I do have a lua-based texture3D-based version on my website at http://christopheremoore.net/gpu-volumizer/ .  Still a few extensions short of porting that to WebGL myself.

As for the hydrogen atom itself, I had some old quantum mechanics lecture notes laying around.  Thought I would put them to some use.  Good use?  Questionable.  Entertaining use?  For sure.
